Changes for QuantLib 1.8.1:
===========================

QuantLib 1.8.1 is a bug-fix release for version 1.8.

- A test failure with Visual C++ 14 (2015) was avoided. Up to VC++14
  update 2, the compiler would inline a call to std::min and std::max
  incorrectly causing a calculation to fail (thanks to Ivan Cherkasov
  for the heads-up).

- A test failure with the upcoming Boost 1.62 was avoided.  A QuantLib
  test was checking for the stored value of a hash whose value changed
  in Boost 1.62.

- Miscellaneous fixes for the g1d swaption engine and instrument
  (thanks to Peter Caspers).

- Whit Monday was no longer a holiday in Sweden since 2005 (thanks to
  Stefano Fondi).

- A new holiday for election day 2016 was added to the South African
  calendar (thanks to Jasen Mackie).

- A few missing CMakeLists were added to the distributed release
  (thanks to izavyalov for the heads-up).

- An irregular last period in a schedule was not reported as such
  (thanks to Schmidt for the heads-up).
